## Game Modules (In Development)

### Card System

#### Overview

The card system is planned to consist of two parts:

- **Gacha System**
- Three free draws per day.
- Resource-based draws.
- Resource-based draws allow increased consumption to raise the probability of obtaining high-rarity characters.

Planned rarity tiers (6 levels) with default probabilities:

| Rarity | Probability |
|------|------------|
| 1 | 29% |
| 2 | 35% |
| 3 | 19% |
| 4 | 10% |
| 5 | 6% |
| 6 | 1% |

- **Cards**
- Each card has 7 attributes:
 - Character
 - Band affiliation
 - Position
 - Rarity
 - Overall Power
 - Speed
 - Resistance
- Higher rarity increases overall power, skills, and resistance.
- Overall power, speed, and resistance are randomly generated within a range and follow a normal distribution.
- Resistance has a probability to activate when opposing cards attempt to interfere using skills.

#### ~~Commands~~

### Performance System

#### Overview

- Players can participate in **daily solo performances** to earn resources based on performance scores (no manual operation required).
- Earned resources can be used for card gacha.
- Players can also compete against other players’ bands in **band battles**, comparing scores to obtain gacha resources.

### Others
